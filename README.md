# Enterprise CRM Data Migration to Microsoft Dynamics 365

## Program Completion Summary

This repository documents the successful execution of an enterprise-scale CRM data migration program to Microsoft Dynamics 365.  
The program was delivered using Agile sprint-based execution with a focus on stability, data trust, and business enablement.

The outcome is a production-ready CRM platform that is operationally stable, governed, and actively supporting business reporting and analytics.

## Program Objectives (Completed)

- Migrate CRM data to Microsoft Dynamics 365 with full validation
- Execute a zero-downtime production cutover
- Establish post-go-live monitoring and performance baselines
- Automate data quality and reconciliation checks
- Enable standardized KPIs and analytics consumption
- Transition ownership to steady-state operations

## Delivery Model

The program was delivered incrementally through Agile sprints:

- Sprint 0: Program setup, discovery, and planning
- Sprint 1–3: Data migration, validation, and evidence
- Sprint 4: Production cutover, rollback readiness, and hypercare
- Sprint 5: Optimization, monitoring, governance, and business enablement

Detailed sprint documentation is available in the `sprint_logs` directory.

## Risk Management Approach

Key risks addressed during the program included:

- Data loss or corruption  
  Mitigated through multi-layer validation and reconciliation

- Performance regression  
  Addressed through baseline capture and tuning

- Operational blind spots  
  Resolved with monitoring and alerting enablement

- Low business adoption  
  Reduced through KPI standardization and analytics enablement

All identified risks were retired by program completion.

## Program Closure

The Enterprise CRM Data Migration Program is formally closed.

Future work will continue as business-driven enhancement initiatives, continuous optimization, and incremental analytics and automation.

No further migration remediation is required.
